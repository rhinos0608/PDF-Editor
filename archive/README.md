## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### GPU Process Crashes
The application automatically disables GPU acceleration to prevent crashes. This is handled by environment variables in the start scripts.

### Build Failures
Run `FIX-ALL.bat` which will:
1. Install missing dependencies (especially babel-loader)
2. Create any missing files
3. Build with fallback mechanisms
4. Archive old files

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Manual fix for babel-loader
npm install babel-loader@^9.1.3 --save-dev

# Complete reinstall
npm run clean:all
npm install
```
