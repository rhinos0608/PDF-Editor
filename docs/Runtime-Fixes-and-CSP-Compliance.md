# Runtime Fixes and CSP Compliance Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the critical runtime fixes implemented to address Content Security Policy (CSP) violations and ArrayBuffer detachment issues that were preventing the PDF Editor from running properly.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

**Problem:** The app was experiencing multiple CSP-related issues:
- Inline styles were being blocked by strict CSP settings
- webpack-dev-server was injecting its own restrictive CSP that blocked PDF.js eval requirements
- The CSP was preventing webpack Hot Module Replacement (HMR) from working

**Solution:** 
- **Replaced all inline styles with CSS classes** in React components
- **Updated webpack-dev-server CSP configuration** to be development-friendly
- **Enhanced main process CSP** with development vs production modes
- **Added utility CSS classes** for dynamic styling needs

#### Files Modified:
- `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Replaced inline styles with `hidden-input`, `pdf-viewer-wrapper`, and `edit-mode-indicator` classes
- `src/renderer/styles/App.css` - Added CSP-safe utility classes
- `webpack.renderer.config.js` - Added devServer CSP headers configuration
- `src/main/main.ts` - Updated CSP with development/production modes

#### CSP Changes:

**Webpack Dev Server CSP (Development):**
```javascript
// Development CSP - allows webpack HMR and PDF.js
headers: {
  'Content-Security-Policy': [
    "default-src 'self'",
    "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'", // HMR + PDF.js
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
    "worker-src 'self' blob: data:",
    "connect-src 'self' ws: wss: http: https:", // WebSocket for HMR
    // ... other directives
  ].join('; ')
}
```

**Electron Main Process CSP:**
```javascript
// Development vs Production CSP
const csp = isDev ? [
  // More permissive for development
  "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'"
] : [
  // Stricter for production
  "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'" // Still need eval for PDF.js
]
```

### 2. ArrayBuffer Detachment Issues

**Problem:** ArrayBuffers were becoming detached when passed between functions, causing "Cannot perform Uint8Array.slice on a detached ArrayBuffer" errors during PDF operations.

**Solution:**
- **Enhanced `createSafePDFBytes` function** with multiple fallback strategies
- **Added `createSafeArrayBuffer` function** for Electron IPC operations
- **Implemented byte-by-byte copying** as fallback for detached buffers
- **Added comprehensive validation** for PDF data integrity

#### Files Modified:
- `src/renderer/utils/pdfUtils.ts` - Enhanced with robust buffer handling
- `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Updated to use safe buffer creation functions

#### Buffer Handling Strategy:
```typescript
// Strategy 1: Use Uint8Array.from (most robust)
const safeBytes = Uint8Array.from(originalBytes);

// Strategy 2: Manual byte copying (fallback)
for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  safeBytes[i] = originalBytes[i] !== undefined ? originalBytes[i] : 0;
}

// Strategy 3: ArrayBuffer recreation
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(safeBytes.byteLength);
const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);
view.set(safeBytes);
```

## New Utility Classes Added

### CSS Classes in `App.css`:

1. **`.hidden-input`** - For file input elements
2. **`.pdf-viewer-wrapper`** - For PDF viewer container positioning
3. **`.edit-mode-indicator`** - For edit mode notification with animation

```css
.edit-mode-indicator {
  position: fixed;
  top: 80px;
  right: 20px;
  background: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 12px;
  z-index: 1000;
  animation: slideInFromRight 0.3s ease-out;
}
```

## Enhanced Error Handling

### PDF Validation
- **Header validation** - Checks for proper `%PDF-` header
- **EOF marker validation** - Ensures proper PDF termination
- **Size validation** - Prevents processing of corrupted or truncated files

### Buffer Safety
- **Detachment detection** - Tests buffer accessibility before operations
- **Automatic fallbacks** - Multiple strategies for buffer creation
- **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed error reporting and success confirmation

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
# Disable GPU acceleration if needed
ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU=true
DISABLE_GPU=true

# Development debugging
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. CSP Compliance Test
- Open the app and check browser console for CSP errors
- All inline style violations should be resolved
- Components should render without CSP blocking

### 2. ArrayBuffer Safety Test
- Open a PDF file (should succeed without detachment errors)
- Perform edit operations (text editing, annotations)
- Save the PDF (should complete without buffer errors)
- Try multiple file operations in sequence

### 3. PDF.js Worker Test
- Verify PDF.js worker loads correctly
- Check console for worker initialization messages
- Ensure PDF rendering works in all scenarios

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Messages to Watch For:
- ✅ `Safe PDF bytes created successfully` - Buffer handling working
- ✅ `PDF.js configured with [strategy] strategy` - Worker loading
- ✅ `PDF bytes validation passed` - File integrity confirmed
- ⚠️ `Primary copy method failed, trying fallback` - Fallback in use (still works)
- ❌ `All safe copy methods failed` - Critical error (needs investigation)

### Performance Impact
The fixes add minimal overhead:
- **CSP-safe classes** - No performance impact, better than inline styles
- **Safe buffer creation** - Minimal overhead, only when needed
- **Validation checks** - Fast validation prevents larger issues later

## Security Considerations

### CSP Settings
- Still maintains strict security posture
- Only allows necessary exceptions for PDF.js functionality
- Blocks all dangerous operations (plugins, unauthorized scripts)

### Buffer Handling
- Prevents memory leaks from detached buffers
- Validates all data before processing
- Graceful degradation on buffer access failures

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic CSP Hash Generation** - Generate hashes for specific inline styles
2. **Worker Service Registration** - Implement service worker for better PDF.js integration
3. **Buffer Pool Management** - Implement buffer pooling for large PDF operations
4. **Progressive Loading** - Stream large PDF files instead of loading entirely in memory

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### App Won't Start
1. Check for CSP errors in console
2. Verify all node modules are installed
3. Try disabling GPU acceleration with environment variables

### PDF Loading Fails
1. Check PDF file integrity with validation messages
2. Verify buffer creation success messages
3. Try with different PDF files to isolate the issue

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor buffer creation frequency
2. Check for memory leaks in detached buffers
3. Consider file size limitations for very large PDFs

### Development vs Production Behavior
- Development mode has relaxed security for debugging
- Production mode enforces stricter CSP
- Worker loading strategies may differ between environments

This comprehensive fix ensures the PDF Editor runs reliably in both development and production environments while maintaining security and performance standards.
