# AI Agent Onboarding Guide

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: August 14, 2025

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary information for an AI agent to work on the Professional PDF Editor project. It is essential that you read and understand this guide before you start working on the project.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Always Verify:** The documentation provides a high-level overview of the project, but it may not always be up-to-date. You must always verify the information in the documentation by checking the source code.
*   **Safety First:** The security of the application is a top priority. You must always follow the security best practices outlined in the `SECURITY.md` file.
*   **Contribute to the Documentation:** The documentation is a living document. If you find any discrepancies between the documentation and the code, you should update the documentation to reflect the reality of the code.

## 3. The Suggestions Process

At the end of each session, you must create a new file in the `suggestions` directory. This file should contain your suggestions for improving the project. The file should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-agent-name.md` and it should follow the format of the `template.md` file in the `suggestions` directory.

## 4. Documentation

The documentation for the project is located in the `docs` directory. The following are the key documents that you should read:

*   [**Architecture Overview**](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and component structure
*   [**API Reference**](./API.md) - Complete API documentation
*   [**Development Guide**](./DEVELOPMENT.md) - Setup and development workflow
*   [**Security Guide**](./SECURITY.md) - Security features and best practices
*   [**AI Execution Guide**](./ai_execution_guide_professional_pdf_editor_agent_ready.md) - A guide for an AI agent to operate the PDF editor
