## üéØ Overview

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Reality**: A PDF viewer with broken editing features. Despite extensive documentation and 26+ service classes, most functionality exists only as UI mockups without backend integration.

**What Actually Works:**
- ‚úÖ PDF file loading and viewing
- ‚úÖ Build system and application launch  
- ‚úÖ Adobe-style dark theme UI

**What's Broken Despite Claims:**
- ‚ùå PDF text editing (visual overlays only)
- ‚ùå Annotations (don't persist to files) 
- ‚ùå Digital signatures (mock implementation)
- ‚ùå OCR integration (service exists but disconnected)
- ‚ùå Form editing (UI placeholders only)
