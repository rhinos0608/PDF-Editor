# ✅ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED - prompt() Not Supported in Electron

**Date:** August 13, 2025  
**Issue:** `prompt() is and will not be supported` error preventing annotation tools from working  
**Status:** 🎯 **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

## 🔍 Root Cause Found

The console output you provided showed the exact issue:
```
vendors.js:2 Uncaught Error: prompt() is and will not be supported.
```

This is an Electron security restriction - `prompt()` is disabled in the renderer process for security reasons.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Created Professional Input Dialog Component**
- **File:** `src/renderer/components/InputDialog.tsx`
- **Features:** 
  - Adobe-style dark theme dialog
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel)
  - Focus management and accessibility
  - Clean, professional UI

### **2. Integrated Dialog with App State**
- Added `showInputDialog` and `inputDialogConfig` to app state
- Created helper functions to show/hide dialog
- Passed dialog function to PDFViewer component

### **3. Replaced All prompt() Calls**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
const text = prompt('Enter text:');

// AFTER (Working)
showInputDialog(
  'Add Text Annotation',
  'Enter your text...',
  (text) => {
    onAnnotationAdd({
      type: 'text',
      text,
      // ... rest of annotation data
    });
  }
);
```

## 🎯 What Now Works Perfectly

### **Text Tool** ✅
1. Click Text Tool (T icon)
2. Click anywhere on PDF
3. **Professional dialog appears** asking for text input
4. Type text and press Enter (or click OK)
5. **Text annotation appears exactly where you clicked**

### **Note Tool** ✅  
1. Click Note Tool (sticky note icon)
2. Click anywhere on PDF
3. **Professional dialog appears** asking for note text
4. Enter note and confirm
5. **Yellow note icon appears on PDF**

### **Highlight Tool** ✅
1. Click Highlight Tool 
2. Click and drag across text/areas
3. **Yellow highlight appears in real-time** (no dialog needed)

### **Shape Tool** ✅
1. Click Shape Tool
2. Click and drag to draw rectangles
3. **Blue rectangles appear** (no dialog needed)
