## üìä What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- **Error**: "Unable to find Electron app" / "Cannot find module"
- **Cause**: Electron couldn't resolve the main.js path properly

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Diagnostic System** (`diagnose.js`)
   - Checks all prerequisites
   - Identifies specific issues
   - Generates actionable report

2. **Emergency Launcher** (`emergency-launcher.js`)
   - 4 different launch strategies
   - Auto-fixes common issues
   - Creates emergency mode if needed

3. **Smart Batch Files**
   - `SMART-START.bat` - Intelligent launcher
   - `EMERGENCY-START.bat` - Force start

## üéØ How to Use

### For Quick Start:
1. **Double-click `SMART-START.bat`**
2. Wait for diagnostics to complete

   ```
   node diagnose.js
   ```
   This will tell you exactly what's wrong.

2. **Try Emergency Mode**:
